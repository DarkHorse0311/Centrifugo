Centrifuge + Go = Centrifugo â€“ harder, better, faster, stronger.

First pre-realease already [available](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo/releases)

There is also work in progress under [new documentation](http://fzambia.gitbooks.io/centrifugal/content/)

Why:

* performance
* no need to launch several processes to utilize several cores
* static binary

What's left:

* metrics
* tests
* documentation
* compare with python version (cpu, memory, performance etc)
